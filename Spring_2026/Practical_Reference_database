## Crabs example of building a reference database
## Imagine Norway has a total of e.g. 50 fish species present in territorial waters. 

### Pre-curation
## Our authoritative taxonomy is Catalog of Fishes 
## Include examples of synonymy (which should be fixed during pre-curation)
## Include examples of misidentified specimens (which should be excluded/blacklisted during pre-curation)
## Include examples of species missing barcodes (which we cannot fix bioinformatically)
## Include examples of barcode overlap (general problem with the marker chosen)
## Include examples of perfect taxonomic resolution (sometimes it works really well)

## Hybrids
## Subspecies?
## Ambiguous basepairs?
## Reinstating barcodes that do not pass criteria

### Post-curation checks
## Fill in a premade sheet of species characteristics in terms of the database (exercise for students)
## Follow up questions with some information about primer mismatches and likelihoods of detection?
